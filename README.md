# Description
The aim of this repo is to provide a playground for Redux in the simplest form possible and with the fewest 'distractions' possible (no unecessary frameworks or packages). It gives the most basic example, to help you see how all the pices fit together - once that's clear for you, for more functionality (async behaviours etc...), you can refer to the code generated by the `create-react-app` described below.

To demonstrate Redux's standard practices, this was based from the project created by the `npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript` command as described in [the Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started#create-a-react-redux-app).
